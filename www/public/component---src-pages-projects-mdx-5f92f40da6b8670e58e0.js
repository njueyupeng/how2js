So on a tight deadline an accessible, responsive and most importantly helpful modal/error overlay had to be created. Since Fast Refresh relies on stricter “code style” rules (e.g. no anonymous exports, only one export per file) compared to previous Hot Reloading solutions two things had to be done: 1) Ensure that Gatsby’s frontend itself handles all possible files gracefully (e.g. MDX) and 2) that ESLint warnings were added to warn against those now bad code styles. The end result is an accessible modal (with focus trap, correct aria labels, respects ",(0,n.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"prefers-*")," media queries) showing multiple types of errors.

Incorporating the bug reports and feature requests from the community, adding unit & end-to-end tests, writing documentation. A lot of work went into the polishing of this feature and ensuring that most common use cases were covered — since the goal of this new feature was to abstract some lower-level Gatsby APIs away into the filename itself. It greatly improved the DX of Gatsby and lowered the level of entry for each user. Challenges were different encodings/formats of file names, some feature requests from users, and the question of what the final API surface should look like.
